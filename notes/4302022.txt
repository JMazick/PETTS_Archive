maybe we can write a portion of the code to manually inhale and exhale vs the pressure sensor telling the pump when to inhale/exhale

inhale

we need to make sure trch is far enough in

we need to look inside baby clear tubein trach site
black u shaped sensor around tube

take the head off and look at trach sensor

maybe get a shorter thin tube

trach sensor came off around the tube
need to take the head off and use a new tie

extra bite of data in js that states whether each 

take black sensor off the tube and try to remove 

manuall simulate trach change on instructor dash

issue could be the sensor or motherbord inside the torso

could replace the sensor or change trach change function

arduino software install
ben will make changes
text on the button will change

schedule a call to do walkthru of the software/program
